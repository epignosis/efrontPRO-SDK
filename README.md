efrontPRO-SDK
=============

eFront PRO provides a comprehensive REST JSON API that allows interaction with remote services. 
Authentication is based on an API key that is defined under your installationâ€™s system settings. 
The functionality provided focuses on performing tasks meaningful for a remote service, such as 
user creation, course assignment, listing courses etc. In addition, one can use the API to provide 
basic SSO for users.

To ease implementation of services, we provide a SDK library for PHP that automates the tasks of 
communicating with the API. The first part of this guide provides a detailed description of the 
available API calls, as well as information on authentication and error handling. The second part of 
the guide demonstrates the use of the PHP SDK, providing information on setting it up and performing 
some basic tasks.
